Darkness is all around you, a damp and pungeant smell fills your nose.
You see a light in the distance, too small to know what it is yet.
As you draw closer, it almost sounds like whispers.
You hear faint begging of a woman, 'Please... save me...'
Finding a fork in the tunnel you can only hope you've chosen the right path
Rumbling in the dungeon, you hope it is merely an earthquake
'Please... hurry...', you hear the woman again, this time louder
You are reinvigorated, steadfast in your duty to save a damsel in distress
The light is blinding now, you hear a gutteral laughter just ahead
The troll king stands before you, snarling in disgust at your puny stature
